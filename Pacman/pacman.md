**Pacman**

> A Pacman of if I must say a pretty hungry once

This pacman eats away the grid if made to move in a particular fashion and the level is a desert with only less than 10 pellets to feed on. The ghosts are so AI that one of it do not move at all and the other vanishes slowly like a real ghost.

This pacman can explore an infinite world that is beyond the grid, once you move it through those tunnels on either sides it starts on its journey but you are not lucky enough to experience that. The only way yo get it back is if you remember and backtrack all the keys you pressed after it left the screen


This programs was left in the middle as I soon realized that I have to prepare for my final exams, which BTW I screwed up big time.
