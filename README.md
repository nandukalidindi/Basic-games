**1. Boggle**:
A C++ program which mimics the logic of Wordament(not completely but can manage to get a decent rank if the words presented are being mapped properly on the Wordament GRID
Unfortunately there is no executable but a Ruby version will soon follow which can be run on a terminal.

Vintage Breakout rip off

**3. Clickslide**:
Minimalist game which just sprouts colorful square blocks from one side of the screen on the click of a button (Still regretting as to why the button was named `nandu`)
(Executable JAR)

**4. Pacman**:
A rather strong pacman capable of going out of the boundary, eat the environment(this feature requires great practice :P, the angle of contact must be precise to eat some blocks) but is deprived of food(10 pellets).
